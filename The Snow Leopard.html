	<h2>Basics: </h2>
	<p>	
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Common Name - </strong> Snow Leopard
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Scientific Name - </strong> <i>Panthera uncia</i>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		Snow Leopards are not endangered or extinct and there are quite a few of them around the Himalayas. They are at the top of the food chain and have a steady population.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Snow Leopard species are usually found alone without any other Snow Leopards nearby. They live alone and only rarely you will see a Male Snow Leopard with a Female Snow Leopard. They hunt and travel alone and move around alot. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Snow Leopards interact with others of their own species a little bit. Since they live by themselves, they do not really interact with others. Rarely you will see a Male and Female Species around and have a kid. Once that kid is around 2 years old, they take off from their mother and try to hunt and survive by themselves. But, they communicate with one each other by leaving markings on rocks so that another Snow Leopard will know that a Snow Leopard was here.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Snow Leopards usually interact with other species by eating them. The Snow Leopards are carnivores and so they eat a variety of animals like sheep and goats. They are hunters and so they try to eat other organisms and do not really interact with them a lot besides killing and eating them for survival.

	<h2>Adpatations: </h2>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Structural Adaptation - </strong> One Structural Adaptation is its extra large paws. Since it can be mostly found in the high regions of the Himalayas in the snow, these large paws help it from sinking in the snow, like snow shoes, allowing for a better hunt helping them survive.

			</div>
			
			<li>
				<strong>Physiologocal Adaptation - </strong> A Physiological Adaptation is their ability to develop a really strong chest as they grow which allows for them to draw oxygen from the thin air that is in the top of the mountains. They can maintain homeostasis this way as they are getting a constant air supply from their strong chest helping it survive since it can breath better.
			</li>
			&nbsp;
			<li>
				<strong>Behavioral Adaptation - </strong> A Behavioral Adaptation would be that they mark their territory with stones and scratches so that no other animal can come in and try to claim it as its own. This way, rivals would be kept away and Snow Leopards would have their territory claimed allowing it to live in a safe place and survive.

	<h2>Population Limiting Factors:</h2>
	<h4>Density Dependent - </h4>
	<p>
		One factor that limits the growth of the Snow Leopards population is their availability of prey. The Snow Leopards usually only eat 2 types of wild animals, the Ibex and the Arbali, and 3 types of domestic animals, Horse, Camel, and Goats. Since there are only two types of prey, they are usually short on food and die of starvation. Their prey are not totally common in the Himalayas and the Snow Leopards only eat a handful of prey and so because the availability of their prey is really low, the Snow Leopards die mostly of starvation which causes its population to be stable and limits the growth.
	</p>
	<p>
		The factor is biotic because it relates to living things, the prey, and affects the population. A biotic factor is some living thing that affects another thing. Since the availability of the prey is a living thing, the factor is biotic. This factor is also density dependent because based on the population size of the Snow Leopards, the availability of the prey would have different effects. If the Snow Leopards have a low population density, then the availability of the prey would not be that important since there are less Snow Leopards. However, if there is a greater population density, then the availability of the prey would make a huge difference since they need more orey to feed on since their population is big. We know its density dependent because it is a biotic factor and based on the population density of the Snow Leopards, the availability of the prey would affect the leopards differently since with less population density, there will be little effect but with a high population density, the availability if the prey is a big effect as the leopards need more animals to eat.

	<h4>Density Independent - </h4>
	<p>
		Another factor that limits the growth of the Snow Leopards population is the cold climate in the Himalayas. Because of the cold weather and low temperature, the Snow Leopards have adapted to survive in the Himalayas and if the climate increases, the Snow Leopards would not be able to survive. The climate helps make sure that the Snow Leopards population is limited by having a cool temperature where the Snow Leopards can survive but in some months, having a warmer climate so that the Snow Leopards do not grow too much.
	</p>
	<p>
		This factor is abiotic because it relates to weather and weather is not a living thing so, it is abiotic. The climate is not a living thing making it an abiotic factor. It is also density independent because the climate will have the same effect whether the population density of the Snow Leopards are high or low. The climate could affect the leopards either way because if the Snow Leopards have a smaller population density, the climate will limit the growth and if there is a higher population density, the climate would have the same effect and limit the growth. We know this factor is density independent because it is an abiotic factor and climate would have the same effect on the population if it is a high density or lower density since climate would not change its effect.
