	<h2>Keystone Species: </h2>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Scientific Name: </strong> <i>Rhododendron maddenii</i>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Common Name: </strong> Rhododendron
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		This species is a keystone species because of its habitat and its prey. This Rhododendron is located from the sub-alpine region of the Himalayas to the Alpine region. Because of where its located, it helps maintain the balance throughout the Himalayas. Also, almost all primary consumers eat this Rhododendron such as the Marco Polo Sheep, Markhor Goat, and the Ibex. This Rhododendron feeds most of these primary consumers and helps them survive which would help all of the secondary and tertiary consumers survive as well. The reason why this Rhododendron is a keystone species is because it feeds most primary consumers and is available throughout the alpines making all of the animals fed which helps balance out the food chain making it the Keystone Species.

	<h2>Endangered Species: </h2>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Scientific Name - </strong> <i>Elephas maximus</i>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Common Name - </strong> Asian Elephant
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		This species is an endangered species for the Himalayas because its population is very low and is constantly decreasing. These Elephants are having their habitat removed and are dying from poachers which constantly decrease their population making them endangered. Also, since they are losing their natural resources, they are dying causing them to be endangered. The population has changed over time because in 2010, their population was about 45,000 elephants but now, they are at about 20,000 elephants. In addition, from here on out, their population is decreasing about 50 percent each year causing them to go extinct. Their population is changing because it is decreasing a lot over time putting them on the endangered list. The main factors that cause them to be endangered are loss of habitat due to human settlement, poaching for their tusks, and being captured alive for domestic uses. Humans are the main cause for all of these which means that the elephants are endangered due to human involvement.

	<h2>Human Impacts: </h2>
	<h4>Positive Human Impact - </h4>
	<p>
		One positive human impact on the Himalayas is the terracing that we do. Terracing is basically building steppes on the side of mountains to help with water flow and soil erosion. Humans have done a lot of terracing in the Himalayas, which helps with the conservation of wildlife. Due to terracing, erosion now has a minimal impact on the land which helps maintain the habitat of wildlife. Also, terracing slows down the speed of the water flow so that the water can be sucked up by the soil and nurture the crops. The water provides many nutrients needed for the land and so by slowing it down, the soil can capture those nutrients. Terracing allows for wildlife to flourish even more since their habitat will maintain longer due to the minimal impact of erosion and the faster growth of plants due to a slower water speed.

	<h4>Negative Human Impact - </h4>
	<p>
		One negative impact humans had on the Himalayas is destruction of the habitat of the wildlife due to human settlement. Many humans begin to live in the base of the Himalayas where the soil is rich in nutrients for farming. Since these people need to farm, they clear out the trees and habitats of the animals. These humans destroy the homes of animals and replace them with farming. Due to this, many animals have become endangered since they no longer have a home because the forests are gone. Human settlement in the Himalayas have caused animals to lose their habitat or home which decreases their population. By getting rid of forests and trees, humans also get rid of animals. Human settlement is the negative impact on the Himalayas as they cause the loss of habitat for the animals causing their population to decrease.
