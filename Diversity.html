	<h2>Community Description: </h2>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Predator/Prey - </strong> A predator/prey relationship is when there is one animal, the predator, that eats the other animal, the prey. The Sand Fox is a Carnivore and a Secondary Consumer in the Himalayas and eats Pikes which are rodents who are primary consumers. Here, the predator or Sand Fox is eating a Pike or the prey. Other Predator/Prey relationships are Wild Boar/Yak, Tibetan Wolf/Blue Sheep, and Asian Black Bear/Marco Polo Sheep.

				<strong>Competition - </strong> Competition is when 2 animals are fighting each other, directly or indirectly, for an object or material, such as nutrients, needed to survive. The Markhors are fighting each other by pushing each other off the cliff so that they could eat the last nut tree. These goats are competing with each other for food and survival. This is intraspecific competition since the animals competing for food are the same species, the Markhor.

			<li>
				<strong>Herbivory - </strong> Herbivory means anything that eats plants. The Himalayan Tahr is a primary consumer or a herbivore and eats a numerous number of wild plants, grass, and herbs such as the Himalaya Fairy Grass, the Himalayan Blackberry, the Himalayan Blue Poppy, the Brahma Kamal and more

	<h2>Symbiotic Relationships: </h2>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Parasitism - </strong> Parasitism is when one species lives off of another and steals from it.  The Himalayan Viagra is a type of parasite that infects many insects, mostly caterpillars, and kills them from within. The Viagra is a fungus that attaches itself on caterpillars, and lives off of the caterpillar eventually killing it by stealing the caterpillars energy.

			&nbsp;
			<li>
				<strong>Commensalism - </strong> Commensalism is when one species benefits from another but the other species is unaffected. The Red Panda and the Evergreen Tree are in a relationship since the Red Panda builds its nests and rests on top of the Evergreen Tree, but the tree is not affected at all. The Evergreen Tree is not harmed or benefited from the Red Panda but the Red Panda is benefited by the tree because it provides a home.

			&nbsp;
			<li>
				<strong>Mutualism - </strong> Mutualism is when two different species work together and both benefit. The Himalayan Griffon Vulture and the Snow Leopard have a Mutualism Symbiotic Relationship because when the Snow Leopard eats its prey, the carcass and leftovers would be eaten by the vulture. During this time, the vulture would not attack the leopard or disturb it. Both animals benefit because the vulture is getting fed and the leopard would not be eaten.

	<h2>Succession Description: </h2>
	<p>
		The disturbance in the Himalayas would be the amount of avalanches that occur in the higher mountain ranges like Lhotse. Many of these avalanches are Loose Snow Avalanches and affect the wildlife the most but not so much humans. This disturbance wipes out many animals or pushes and separates them. For example, if a Loose Snow Avalanche occurs, then animals like the Himalayan Yak and Snow Leopards would be pushed down to the bottom of the mountain and will be separated from their family or could die with the fall depending on the size of the avalanche. The wildlife in the top of the mountain like the Chir Pine Tree or Deodar Cedar Tree would also be wiped out and all fallen. The entire ecosystem at the top of the mountain would be broken with no animals and fallen plants and trees.

	<p>
		This is a secondary succession because the avalanches, which is the disturbance, occurs in the higher elevated mountains where there are plenty of animals and trees and the disturbance wipes them all out but they recover and come back after a couple of years. Since this disturbance occurs in an area where a was community once put in place, and after the disturbance or avalanche the community slowly reforms after years, it is a secondary succession. The avalanche is a secondary succession since it wipes the community but the ecosystem reforms after some years and the avalanche or disturbance occurs where a community is.

	<h2>Biodiversity: </h2>
	<p>
		Biodiversity is seen in my ecosystem, the Himalayas, because of the different species of fauna and flora present. First off, the Himalayas have different layers with different environments like one layer is cold, has jagged rocks, and full of snow while other layers are full of forests and wooded area causing biodiversity. Different species of animals live all around like the Red Panda, Himalayan Tahr, different types of Yaks, the Pike, and Snow Leopards. All of these animals live in different parts of the Himalayas and add to the diversity in the ecosystem. Other types of plants also are present such as the Himalayan Blackberry, Evergreen Tree, Bamboo Trees, and Indian Horse Chestnuts. These organisms live in different parts like some trees such as the Evergreen Tree live in the Tropical Rainforests while animals like the Snow Leopard live in the freezing Alpine weather. Since these organisms are very different and live in different regions, it all adds to the biodiversity. My ecosystem is more diverse than others because it has different regions with different ecosystems like Temperate Forests in some and Alpine or Cooler ecosystem in other places and the most prominent group is the Plant Kingdom with over 4,000 species of plants.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the pictures, there are a numerous different species from each kingdom. For example, in the animal kingdom, there is the Giant Panda and Pika. While in the plant kingdom, the pictures show the Himalayan Autumn Poppy and for the fungi kingdom, the Himalayan Viagra is shown as well. In addition, the Chloroplastida protist and the Arthrobacter psychrolactophilus bacteria are also pictured. The collage of pictures shows biodiversity as it has images of organisms from every animal kingdom. The Himalayas show biodiversity because of the many organisms that are from different kingdoms. The collage is able to highlight the different ecosystems and organisms from all kingdoms showing biodiversity.
